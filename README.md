# WP2

## Overview

The WP2 Template is a WordPress starter framework built for modern, block-based, component-driven development. It leverages Full Site Editing (FSE) and the Block Editor to provide a controlled, programmatically generated environment. This approach ensures that while clients enjoy full site editing, they’re limited to making only approved, localized changes without the risk of deviating from the baseline design.

## Requirements

- **WordPress:** The application framework
- **Blockstudio:** The block framework
- **Bootstrap:** The design framework

## Key Concepts

### Programmatically Generated Themes & Templates
Themes, templates, and their parts are generated by code rather than manually built. Knowing the exact depth and location from the outset lets you precisely control the editing experience.

### Strictly Controlled Full Site Editing
Every template comes with its own set of template parts. Drill down without switching contexts, and ensure that every change is localized and contained.

- Localized Changes: Editing a template part (e.g., a header) only impacts that particular template.

- Controlled Experiments: You can test new patterns in a confined context. Even if clients are allowed to modify inner blocks (with locking disabled in production), the changes remain minimally invasive and isolated.

### Custom Context-Aware Blocks

- Wrapped Core Blocks: Complex elements such as navigation or search are wrapped (e.g., as site-menu or site-search) so you extend their functionality without re-creating them.

- Semantic Blocks: Instead of relying on clients to assign correct HTML semantics (header, footer, main, aside, nav), dedicated custom blocks ensure all elements meet technical SEO standards.

- Queried-Item Blocks: Replace duplicative blocks (multiple title, excerpt, or description blocks) with context-aware blocks that dynamically provide the intended visual element in any loop or template position. Special blocks handle traditionally cumbersome items like authors, dates, bylines, and datelines with precision.

### Minimalistic Styling with Modern Tooling

Blend of traditional responsive development with intrinsic design for pixel-perfect outcomes. 

- All assets are handled natively via BlockStudio, with SCSS and ES module support and no external build tools required.
- The system imports only what’s needed—the Bootstrap grid, responsive utilities, and select mixins—without extra styles. 

###  Distraction-Free Editor Experience

The WP2 Template removes every unnecessary element from the site editor. 
- No third-party patterns or media libraries cluttering the interface
- A rules engine governs blocks by context, streamlining the editing process.

## Project Structure

The WP2 Template is organized as a WordPress project with a custom theme and plugins:

### WP Content Hierarchy

```plaintext
wp-content/
├── mu-plugins/
│   └── wp2-bootstrap/        # Must-use plugins (Template Bootstrap Daemon)
├── themes/
│   └── wp2/                  # Core Theme
└── plugins/
├── wp2/                  # Core Plugin
└── wp2-bootstrap/        # Template Bootstrap Plugin
```

### Application Code

All primary application code resides in wp-content/plugins/wp2/src, which includes:

#### Assets

The assets directory contains all styles and scripts that are shared across the application. Each asset is organized by type and purpose, with a clear separation of concerns. The build process is handled by BlockStudio, which compiles and enqueues assets as needed.

```plaintext
Assets/
├── Styles/                             #
│   ├── scss/                           # 
│   │   ├── Blocks/                     # 
│   │   ├── Elements/                   # 
│   │   ├── Zones/                      # 
│   │   ├── admin-styles.scss           #
│   │   ├── block-editor-styles.scss    #
│   │   ├── global-styles.scss          # 
│   Scripts/                            #
│   ├── global-scripts.js               #     
```

#### Block Extensions
These extend and configure existing blocks using a centralized extension.json file and initialization scripts.

**Core Blocks:**

- **Template Part:** The template part block is the primary block that wraps the template part.

#### Blocks

**Site:**

- **Root:** The root block is the primary block that wraps the entire
- **Header:** The header block is the primary block that wraps the header.
- **Content:** The content block is the primary block that wraps the content.
- **Footer:** The footer block is the primary block that wraps the footer.

**Semantic:**

- **Header:** 
- **Footer:**
- **Main:**
- **Aside:**
- **Nav:**

**Focus:**

- **Primary:** The primary block is the primary block that wraps the primary.
- **Secondary:** The secondary block is the primary block that wraps the secondary.

**Content:**

- **Article:** The article block is the primary block that wraps the article.
- **Query:** The query block is the primary block that wraps the query.

**Item:**
Queried Item Block are context-aware blocks that replace duplicative and confusing implementations of titles, excerpts, and more.

**Miscellaneous:**

#### Filters
Manage block editor behaviors, block patterns, allowed block types, body class modifications, and template configurations.

#### Helpers 
Provide functionality for used throughout the application.

- **Asset:** Retrieves the asset from the theme directory, constructs a response, enriches the it, and returns the asset payload.
- **Context:** Given contextual arguments parameters, parse, evaluate, and return a string that defines the context.
- **Query:** Define, construct, query, stash, item queries, and return the query when provided query arguments, including custom named queries.

#### Templates
Template controllers. Each template can have its own controller, which is responsible for any template-specific logic, styles, and scripts.

Each directory name matches to the template hierarchy using pascal case (e.g., Archive, FrontPage, 404).

**404**
- Disables attempt to guess a redirect URL for a 404 request.

**Archive**
- Constructs the main archive query.

**Front Page**
- Constructs the front page query.

### Template Bootstrap Process

The wp2-bootstrap plugin streamlines the site generation process, ensuring a clean, programmatic creation of a new site instance:
Daemon:
Located in wp-content/mu-plugins/wp2-bootstrap.php, it provides CLI commands to run the bootstrapping process.
Plugin Lifecycle:
Residing in wp-content/plugins/wp2-bootstrap, the plugin handles:
Activation
Deactivation
Uninstall routines
The full lifecycle is triggered by running the CLI command:
```bash
wp wp2-bootstrap run
```
After bootstrapping, the plugin is designed to be uninstalled, leaving behind a fully configured site.
After bootstrapping, the plugin is designed to be uninstalled, leaving behind a fully configured site.

Webhook Integration:
A webhook address can be set in wp-config.php so that during CLI command execution, events are sent to trigger additional actions or workflows.

The WP2 Template delivers a robust framework that marries the flexibility of full site editing with strict, programmatically enforced controls. By generating themes and templates in a predictable and isolated manner, it allows for fine-tuned customizations that remain consistent, localized, and secure. Whether you’re tweaking a single template part or managing complex blocks, WP2 ensures that every change adheres to your design and development standards.
