# Extensions

Blockstudio comes bundled with several extensions that enhance its functionality. WP2 also introduces additional extensions to further extend Blockstudio's capabilities.
This directory contains extensions that add support for external libraries:

- **Bootstrap** – Integrates Bootstrap components and styling.
- **Tailwind** – Adds Tailwind CSS configuration and utilities.
- **Twig** – Enables Twig templating for block rendering.

Each extension is initialized separately and can be customized as needed.
