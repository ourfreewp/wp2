# Handlers

Handlers in WP2 Studio are responsible for executing the callback logic that extends Blockstudio’s functionality.  
They listen for actions and filters (such as those for blocks, assets, settings, and instances) and process them accordingly.

Subdirectories include:

- **Asset** – Logic for asset processing.
- **Block** – Handlers for block rendering and manipulation.
- **Callback** – General-purpose callback functions.
- **Instance** – Instance-specific initialization and behavior.
- **Setting** – Handling of settings-related logic from across the application.
