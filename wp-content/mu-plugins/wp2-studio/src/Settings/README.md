# Settings

The Settings directory centralizes configuration for WP2 Studio, extending Blockstudioâ€™s defaults.  
It is divided into logical subgroups to manage global settings, user access, asset handling, editor configurations, block editor options, and the block library.

Each subdirectory registers its own filters to control how WP2 Studio operates.
