# Types

The Types directory defines the core data structures and domain logic that WP2 Studio uses to extend Blockstudio.  
This includes definitions for block types, icons, instances, and validation rules. These types form the backbone of how blocks are structured and behave.

Each subfolder contains type definitions that can be extended as your project evolves. By organizing these types, you can ensure consistency and maintainability across your project. Not all types are registered as post types or taxonomies, but they are essential for the functionality of WP2 Studio.
