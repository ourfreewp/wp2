# Source Code

This directory contains the source code for the WP2 Directory module. It is organized into several key sections:

- **Blocks:** UI components and modular pieces.
- **Catalogs:** Version-controlled records of supported works.
- **Types:** Definitions and classifications used throughout the module.

Each sub-directory is structured to promote maintainability and clarity as you work with the codebase.
